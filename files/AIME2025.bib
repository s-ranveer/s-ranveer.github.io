abstract="Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a method for supporting patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure. However, pediatric ECMO patients are at a higher risk of severe neurological injury (NI). Understanding underlying causal mechanisms is critical for clinical decision-making. To this effect, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the construction of Causal Bayesian networks. While LLMs can reproduce causal relationships reflected in their training data, they may also generate spurious associations. We address this by refining the LLM-generated BN using data from 71 patients and domain constraints elicited from our experts. Our empirical evaluation shows that our method can construct causal diagrams by combining domain knowledge with empirical patterns.",
